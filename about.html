<h4>How to</h4>
<p>Choose one of the chart presets from a dropdown list and click 'Add chart' button.</p>
<p>Most charts display additional curve 'NaN', which show the data accuracy. Greater value means lower accuracy or insufficient data (lower is better).</p>

<h4>Data source</h4>
<p>As data source UNODC <strong>Percentage of homicides by firearm, number of homicides by firearm and homicide by firearm rate per 100,000 population</strong> <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Homicides_by_firearms.xls">document</a> was used.</p>
